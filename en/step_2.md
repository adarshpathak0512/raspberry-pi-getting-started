## Meet the Raspberry Pi 

Let's take a look at the Raspberry Pi. You should have a Raspberry Pi computer in front of you for this. It shouldn't be connected to anything yet.



Look at your Raspberry Pi. Can you find all the things labelled on the diagram.

+ __USB ports__ - these are used to connect a USB mouse and keyboard and other peripherals such as a USB storage drive.

+ __SD Card slot__ - the SD card slots in underneath the Raspberry Pi, this is where the operating system and your files are stored.

+ __Ethernet port__ - this is used to connect the Raspberry Pi to the network (it can also connect to a Wifi network)

+ __Audio Jack__ - this is where you connect headphones or speakers.

+ __HDMI Port__ - this is where you connect the monitor (or projector) that you are using to display the output from the Pi. If your monitor has speakers you can also get sound.

+ __Micro USB Power connector__ - this is where you connect a power supply. You should always do this last.

+ __GPIO Ports__ - these allow you to connect electronics components such as LEDs and buttons to the Pi.
