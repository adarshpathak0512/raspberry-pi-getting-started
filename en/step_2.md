## Challenge: Explore the Pi

Take some time to explore the Pi.

Can you find:

+ A version of Scratch

+ A Python game to play

+ A version of Minecraft that you can program (you'll find out more about that later.)

If you are connected to the internet then you can also try browsing the web.

+ Can you find out how the Raspberry Pi got its name?

Note: You can also try any of the regular [Code Club projects](codeclubprojects.org) on the Raspberry Pi.
