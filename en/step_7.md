You might want to connect your Raspberry Pi to the internet. If you didn't plug in an ethernet cable then you will need to connect to a wireless network.

+ Click the arrows icon with red crosses on the top-right of the screen and select your network from the dropdown. You may need to ask an adult which network you should choose.

+ Type in the WiFi password for your network, or ask an adult to type it for you, then press OK.
