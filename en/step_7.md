You might want to connect your Raspberry Pi to the internet. If you didn't plug in an ethernet cable, then you will need to connect to a wireless network.

To enable a wireless network you will need to set a Wi-Fi country.

Once you Wi-Fi country is set you can connect to a wireless network.

+ Click the icon with red crosses in the top right-hand corner of the screen, and select your network from the drop-down menu. You may need to ask an adult which network you should choose.
