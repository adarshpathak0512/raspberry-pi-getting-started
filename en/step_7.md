You might want to connect your Raspberry Pi to the internet. If you didn't plug in an ethernet cable, then you will need to connect to a wireless network.

+ Click the icon with red crosses in the top right-hand corner of the screen, and select your network from the drop-down menu. You may need to ask an adult which network you should choose.

+ Type in the password for your wireless network, or ask an adult to type it for you, then click **OK**.

+ When your Pi is connected to the internet, you will see a wireless LAN symbol instead of the red crosses.
