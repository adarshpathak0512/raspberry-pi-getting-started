## Connect your Raspberry Pi

Let's connect up your Raspberry Pi and get it running.

+ Check whether your Raspberry Pi already has an SD card in the slot at the underside, and if not, insert an SD card with Raspbian installed (via NOOBS). Lots of SD cards will come inside a larger adapter, and you can slide the card out of this using the lip at the bottom.

+ Find the USB connector for your mouse, and connect the mouse to one of the USB port on the Raspberry Pi (it doesn't matter which one).

+ Connect the keyboard in the same way.

+ Look at the HDMI port on the Raspberry Pi — notice that it has a large flat side on top.

Make sure your monitor is plugged into a wall socket and turned on.

+ Connect the monitor cable to the Pi's HDMI port — use an adapter if necessary.

Nothing will display yet.  

+ Connect headphones or speakers to the audio jack if you have some.

+ If you have one, use an ethernet cable to connect the ethernet port on the Raspberry Pi to an ethernet socket on the wall or on your router. (You don't need to do this if you'll be using wireless LAN or if you don't want to connect to the internet.)

+ Notice that the micro USB power port has a longer flat side on top.

Plug the power supply into a socket and connect it to the micro USB power port.

You should see a red light on the Raspberry Pi and raspberries on the monitor.

The Pi will boot up into a graphical desktop.
