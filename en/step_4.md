## Connect Your Pi

Now you're going to connect up your Raspberry Pi and get it running.

+ Check that your Raspberry Pi has an SD card in the slot underneath the Pi, if not, ask your Club Leader for help.

+ Find the USB connector for your mouse.

	Make sure the USB symbol is facing upwards and connect the keyboard to a USB port on the Raspberry Pi. It doesn't matter which one.

+ Connect the keyboard in the same way.

+ Look at the HDMI port and notice that it has a large flat side on top.

	Make sure your monitor is plugged in and turned on.

	Connect the monitor cable to the HDMI port, using an adapter if necessary.

	Nothing will display yet.  

+ Optionally, connect headphones or speakers to the Audio Jack.

+ Optionally, connect an ethernet cable from an ethernet socket to the ethernet port on the Raspberry Pi. (You don't need to do this if you'll be using Wifi or not connecting to the internet.)

+ Notice that the micro USB power port has a longer flat side on top.

	Plug in the power supply and connect it to the micro USB power input.

	You should see a red light on the Raspberry Pi and raspberries on the monitor.

	The Pi will boot up into a graphical desktop.
