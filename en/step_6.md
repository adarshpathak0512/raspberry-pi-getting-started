+ Your file has been saved to the Raspberry Pi's SD card.

+ Close the text editor by clicking the 'X'

+ Return to the Raspberry menu and choose 'Shutdown' and then choose 'Reboot'.

+ When the Pi reloads your file should still be there.

+ The Raspberry Pi runs a version of an operating system called Linux (Windows and OS X are other operating systems.) You can type commands to do things. Click on the terminal at the top of the screen:
