+ Your file has been saved to the Raspberry Pi's SD card.

+ Close the text editor by clicking the 'X'

+ Return to the Raspberry menu and choose 'Shutdown' and then choose 'Restart'.

+ When the Pi reloads your file should still be there.

+ The Raspberry Pi runs a version of an operating system called Linux (Windows and OS X are other operating systems.) You can type commands to do things. Click on the Command Prompt at the top of the screen:

+ Now type:

	```
	ls
	```

	and then press enter on the keyboard.

	This will list the files in your 'home' directory (folder.)

+ Now type:

	```
	cd Desktop
	```

	You have to press the enter key after every command.

	Type:

	```
	ls
	```

	Can you see the file you created?

+ Close the command prompt by clicking on the 'X'.

+ Now drag `rp.txt` to the Wastebasket in the desktop so the Pi will be ready for the next person.
