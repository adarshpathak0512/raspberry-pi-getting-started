## Meet the Raspberry Pi

Let's take a look at the Raspberry Pi. You should have a Raspberry Pi computer in front of you for this. It shouldn't be connected to anything yet.

Look at your Raspberry Pi. Can you find all the things labelled on the diagram.

+ __USB ports__ - these are used to connect a mouse and keyboard. You can also connect other components such as a USB drive.

+ __SD Card slot__ - the SD card slots in underneath the Raspberry Pi. This is where the operating system software and your files are stored.

+ __Ethernet port__ - this is used to connect the Raspberry Pi to a network with a cable. The Raspberry Pi can also connect to a network via WiFi.

+ __Audio jack__ - this is where you connect headphones or speakers.

+ __HDMI port__ - this is where you connect the monitor (or projector) that you are using to display the output from the Raspberry Pi. If your monitor has speakers you can also use them to hear sound.

+ __Micro USB power connector__ - this is where you connect a power supply. You should always do this last.

+ __GPIO ports__ - these allow you to connect electronic components such as LEDs and buttons to the Raspberry Pi.
