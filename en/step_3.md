## Meet the Raspberry Pi

Let's take a look at the Raspberry Pi. You should have a Raspberry Pi computer in front of you for this. It shouldn't be connected to anything yet.

+ Look at your Raspberry Pi. Can you find all the things labelled on the diagram?

+ __USB ports__ — these are used to connect a mouse and keyboard. You can also connect other components, such as a USB drive.

+ __SD card slot__ — you can slot the SD card in here. This is where the operating system software and your files are stored.

+ __Ethernet port__ — this is used to connect the Raspberry Pi to a network with a cable. The Raspberry Pi can also connect to a network via wireless LAN.

+ __Audio jack__ — you can connect headphones or speakers here.

+ __HDMI port__ — this is where you connect the monitor (or projector) that you are using to display the output from the Raspberry Pi. If your monitor has speakers, you can also use them to hear sound.

+ __Micro USB power connector__ — this is where you connect a power supply. You should always do this last, after you have connected all your other components.

+ __GPIO ports__ — these allow you to connect electronic components such as LEDs and buttons to the Raspberry Pi.
