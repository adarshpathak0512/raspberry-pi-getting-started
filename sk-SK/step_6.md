Your file has been saved to the Raspberry Pi's SD card.

+ Close the text editor by clicking the **X** in the top right-hand corner of the window.

+ Return to the Raspberry menu, choose **Shutdown**, and then choose **Reboot**.

+ When the Pi has rebooted, your file should still be there.

+ The Raspberry Pi runs a version of an operating system called Linux (Windows and macOS are other operating systems). It allows you to do happen by typing commands instead of clicking on menu options. Click on the **Terminal** at the top of the screen:

+ In the window that appears, type:

    ls
    

and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd> on the keyboard.

This will list the files in your `home` directory.

+ Now type this command to **c**hange **d**irectory to the Desktop:

    cd Desktop
    

You have to press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key after every command.

Type:

    ls
    

Can you see the file you created?

+ Close the terminal window by clicking on the **X**.

+ Now drag `rp.txt` to the Wastebasket on the desktop so the Pi will be ready for the next person.
